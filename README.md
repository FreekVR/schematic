Schematic allows you to synchronize your Craft setup over multiple environments

## Usage

Make sure you have your latest export stored at `./craft/config/schema.yml`.

Then just run to import...

```
./craft/app/etc/console/yiic schematic import
```

Optionally you can use --force to make the import delete any items which are not in the import file.
WARNING!! This will also delete any related content.

You can also generate a schema.yml with

```
./craft/app/etc/console/yiic schematic export
```

## Overrides

You can override certain keys by placing them in the file `craft/config/override.yml`. When you place this file in gitignore, you can have different settings for different environments. All the base settings go in `schema.yml` and any specific overrides in `override.yml`.

## Hooks

* Has a hook "registerMigrationService" to add exports with your own data.

```php
public function registerMigrationService()
{
    return array(
		'amnav' => craft()->schematic_amNav
	);
}
```
